Hi. You seem to be a developer, or you're just a guy who's trying to steal the code...
Still, I am glad that someone is interested in our work.

Other files are either textures or music and do not require an introduction


As I've said earlier, the GitHub repository has more content to work with such as bunch of useful tools to make a
MM language file in LUA format.

Yes, THIS GAMETYPE SUPPORTS TRANSLATIONS. You can take /SRC/LUA/TEXT/EN.LUA as the template file for your language
I tried my best to make the tutorial about languages in that template understandable but if you have questions you
can always ask us in our SRB2MM_DEV Discord (or even on GitHub).

If you're new to the LUA you can freely use our code for educational purposes

Have a nice modding!
