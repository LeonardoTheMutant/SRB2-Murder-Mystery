-- LANGUAGE FILE
-- for LeonardoTheMutant's Murder Mystery
--
-- ENGLISH
-- Made by SRB2MM community
--
-- LTM's MM REQUIRES THE ENGLISH VERSION OF THE TEXT TO BOOT AND RUN, DO NOT DISABLE OR REMOVE THIS FILE
--
--
-- You can use this file as a template to make your own language/translation for LTM's MM
-- In case of external language file, THE FILE MUST BE LOADED AFTER THE LTM_MM.PK3
-- Please read everything carefully if you want your custom language to work fine
--
-- NOTES BEFORE YOU START:
-- You can apply color to the text strings in SRB2. Coloring is possible with ESCAPE COLOR CODES. They look like "\x##",
-- where ## is the HEXADECIMAL value. But you can do decimal values instead of hexadecimal
-- I will explain everything with the HEX color codes
--
-- Escape Color Codes will paint the string FROM where they are TO the end of the string (or the other color code).
-- Sounds strange? Well, you'll get it better with this example:
--
-- "\x85HThis part of the string will apear in Red \x83and this one in Green! \x80However this part will be White"
--
-- Still don't understand it? https://wiki.srb2.org/wiki/Lua explains SRB2 text coloring much better.
--
-- Here's another cool trick to make several lines in one string. Place the "\n" symbol inside your string where you would
-- normally press ENTER in the text editor.
-- EXAMPLE: "A string\nof text" will make your string look like:
--
--   A string
--   of text
--
-- Several words about HUD and CHAT strings:
-- All strings which have the "HUD_" or "CHAT_" prefix are UTF-8 compatible. This means you can directly type the text
-- in them and the custom Unicode renderer in MM will render those strings. There is a slight difference on how you
-- should apply the color codes to these strings - color information is stored in Caret Codes. The format of the
-- Caret Code looks like "^#", where # is the single hexadecimal digit that tells what color to use. The color values
-- themself are based on vanilla SRB2 codes, so it should be easy for you to adopt, if you already know how to use the
-- Vanilla Color Codes. If not, visit https://wiki.srb2.org/wiki/Lua to see the color codes.
-- Anyways, here is the example of the HUD string:
--
--   "^5This part of the HUD/CHAT string will appear in RED ^3and this one in Green! ^0This text will appear white"
--
-- Get it? That's great, now you can begin translating!
--
--
--
-- TROUBLESHOOTING:
--
-- "escape sequence wrong size (2 or 4 digits) near ..." warning on load
--     If you get this error when trying to load your language file it means that some of your text is not interpreted
--     correctly by the game. Go to the line where the error occurs and look carefully in places where you have placed
--     the escape color codes in the text.
--     For example, if you write something like "\x85Dictionary" and you want it red the game thinks that "\x85D" is an
--     escape color code and tries to interpret it. In reality, "\x85D" is an invalid code and the game will show an error.
--     To prevent this, you can format the string like "\x85".."Dictionary" (.. in LUA is a string concatenation operator)
--     or if it's in the middle of the text you can fix the error by simply shifting the SPACE symbol.
--     If your text looks like this: "A wonderful \x85Dictionary"
--     Make it like this instead: "A wonderful\x85 Dictionary"
--     This should fix the problem.
--     Remember! A, B, C, D, E, F letters and 0-9 digits can be interpreted as a color code - be careful with them!
--
-- Symbols like ï¿½ or gibberish stuff appear in the HUD lines and/or MMHELP text
--     There might be several reasons for this problem. One of them is that you placed symbols in your text, but there
--     are no font graphics for those symbols. You have to contact our team and kindly ask us to make them for you in
--     the next MM update.
--     Another possible reason is that you placed the color codes incorrectly. Please check your color codes in the text.
--     If you are unsure how they should work, look at this English text example at any time.
--     As a last speculation, your text may contain unreadable symbols that the renderer cannot decode. Make sure you saved
--     your Language File in UTF-8 encoding. If that does not help, try typing the problematic text again, but with the UTF-8 encoding.

--finally import your language to the MM
--There is already a function to add the language in the game
--It has 2 arguments to pass:
-- First argument is the language index string, it is usually 2 or 3 characters long
-- Do not make it like "MyLanguage" - use "MYLANG" or "ML" instead (or the official international index of your language) for the simplicity
-- Second argument is the Table Variable of the language itself
MM.AddLang("EN", language_data)
--if everything is done correctly you will receive no errors when loading this file and in the gameplay process
--
--If this language is going to be posted on the SRB2 Message Board or any other public media please rename this file to something like:
-- MM_LANG_[full_lang_name]_[lang_index]_v[MM_version]_r[this_file_revision].lua
--
--e.g. "MM_LANG_English_EN_v1.3_r0.lua"
--You can ommit the revision number if it is the initial upload of the file

--Thank you for your efforts to make the game more accessible!
