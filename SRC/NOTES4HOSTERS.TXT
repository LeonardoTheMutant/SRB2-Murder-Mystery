Thanks for opening this file, it contains really important information
for those who are going to host this addon pack on their server (including you)

---=== HOW TO LAUNCH THE LTM'S MURDER MYSTERY GAME ===---
A. From the command line:
	1) Add the game-type addon file with "-FILE [path_to_the_addon]" parameter;
	2) Write the name of the gametype to launch like:
	   -gametype LTM_MM
	3) You probably don't want to start from Greenflower1 so you need to use "-WARP MAPK0"
	   to start from MM maps.

	The final command line should be something like:
	srb2win.exe -server (-dedicated) -file [place_where_addon_located]/MM_MurderMystery-v[ver].pk3 -gametype LTM_MM -warp MAPK0

B. From the in-game console:
	MAP [MMmapnum] -GAMETYPE LTM_MM

---=== Admin-only MM commands/variables ===---
There are a couple of Commands and Console Variables available for admins to use. Here are all of them:

VARIABLES
	MM_ABILITIES - Enable/Disable abilities applied by a player's skin. When Disabled, all skins have Sonic1-like abilities
		(spin jump (including Amy & Fang), sneaking (hold SPIN button to walk slower and leave no footmarks)).
		Enable this Variable to remove the ability limit. The default value is NO;
	MM_AFK - used as an AFK timeout value. Measured in minutes. The default value is 2 minutes. If
	    set to 0 AFK timeout is disabled.
	MM_AUTOFIRE - Enable/Disable autofire for all weapons. The default value is ON.
	MM_CHATDELAY - Used for chat spam protection. Sets how much time player has to wait before sending
	    the next message - measured in seconds (default value is 1);
	MM_CRYPTIC - Enable/Disable the "Cryptic game" mode, where most of the player counters, teammates list and
		player nametags are disabled to make the game more cryptic (and feel more like a true mystery)
	MM_CUSTOMSKINS - Allow custom skins/characters in a Murder Mystery game.
		WARNING: CUSTOM SKINS MAY NOT BE DESIGNED FOR THIS GAMETYPE, ENABLE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
		The default value is NO.
	MM_NOCAMPING - Enable/Disable the kicks for Emerald Camping. Murderers who are camping on the \x84Sheriff's Emerald\x80
		for longer than 30 seconds will be kicked. The default value is ON.
	MM_WEPCONFIG - Set how weapons work for each player role (except Innocents) during the normal gameplay or
		showdown duel by setting the individual flags. The variable accepts the *interger* in 0-255 range.
		For more details please see the DEV_DOCS/MM_WEPCONFIG.PNG
	MM_WEPINNO - Enable/Disable weapons for Innocents. Player needs to have 100 rings for each shot/knife usage.
		There are 3 possible values for this CVAR:
			0 - Disable weapons;
			1 - Allow Knife + Red Ring;
			2 - Allow only Knife

COMMANDS
	SAYDEAD - This command is available only for the host player and can be used to send a message to the
	    dead players as <~SERVER>.

---=== List of incompatible Add-On types ===---
Here is the list of Add-On types that can break Murder Mystery and the reasons why they break:

+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Add-On type                    | What does it break              |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Custom characters/abilities    | Can be too OP and ruin the way  |
|                                | MM was meant to be played       |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Custom HUD                     | Can create a mess on the screen.|
|                                | Not much critical for gameplay. |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------=+
| Murder Mystery Custom Language | LUA Errors might occur about    |
| File (not matching version)    | missing string/block of text.   |
|                                | Additionally, text may disappear|
|                                | on the screen entirely          |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
