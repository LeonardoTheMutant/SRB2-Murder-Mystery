Thanks for opening this file, it contains really important information
for those who are going to host this addon pack on their server (including you)

---=== HOW TO LAUNCH THE LTM'S MURDER MYSTERY GAME ===---
A. From the command line:
	1. Add the game-type addon file with "-FILE [path_to_the_addon]" parameter;
	2. Write the name of the gametype to launch like:
	   -gametype LTM_MM
	3. You probably don't want to start from Greenflower1 so you need to use "-WARP MAPK0"
	   to start from MM maps.

	The final command line should be something like:
	[your_SRB2_executable] -server (-dedicated) -file [path_to_the_addon] -gametype LTM_MM -warp MAPK0

B. From the in-game console:
	MAP [MMmapnum] -GAMETYPE LTM_MM

---=== Admin-only MM commands/variables ===---
There are a couple of Commands and Console Variables available for admins to use. Here are all of them:

VARIABLES
	MM_ABILITIES - Enable/Disable abilities applied by a player's skin. When Disabled, all skins have Sonic1-like abilities
		(spin jump (including Amy & Fang), sneaking (hold SPIN button to walk slower and leave no footmarks)).
		Enable this Variable to remove the ability limit. The default value is NO;
	MM_ALLOWSHIELDS - Allow/Restrict the usage of the shields. It is recommended to NOT ALLOW shields usage in the game
		because they can quickly turn the game unplayable and more chaotic. Default value is NO;
	MM_AUTOFIRE - Enable/Disable autofire for all weapons. The default value is ON.
	MM_CRYPTIC - Enable/Disable the "Cryptic game" mode, where most of the player counters, teammates list and
		player nametags are disabled to make the game more cryptic (and feel more like a true mystery)
	MM_CUSTOMSKINS - Allow custom skins/characters in a Murder Mystery game.
		WARNING: CUSTOM SKINS MAY NOT BE DESIGNED FOR THIS GAMETYPE, ENABLE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
		The default value is NO.
	MM_NOCAMPING - Enable/Disable the kicks for Emerald Camping. Murderers who are camping on the \x84Sheriff's Emerald\x80
		for longer than 30 seconds will be kicked. The default value is ON.
	MM_WEPCONFIG - Set how weapons work for each player role (except Innocents) during the normal gameplay or
		showdown duel by setting the individual flags. The variable accepts the *interger* in 0-255 range.
		For more details please see the DEV_DOCS/MM_WEPCONFIG.PNG
	MM_WEPINNO - Enable/Disable weapons for Innocents. Player needs to have 100 rings for each shot/knife usage.
		There are 3 possible values for this CVAR:
			0 - Disable weapons;
			1 - Allow Knife + Red Ring;
			2 - Allow only Knife

COMMANDS
	SAYDEAD - This command is available only for the host player and can be used to send a message to the
	    dead players as <~SERVER>.

---=== List of incompatible Add-On types ===---
Here is the list of Add-On types that can break Murder Mystery and the reasons why they break:

+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Add-On type                    | What does it break              |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Custom characters/abilities    | Can be too OP and ruin the way  |
|                                | MM was meant to be played       |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Custom HUD                     | Can create a mess on the screen.|
|                                | Not much critical for gameplay. |
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------=+
| Murder Mystery Custom Language | LUA Errors might occur about    |
| File (not matching version)    | missing string/block of text.   |
|                                | Additionally, text may disappear|
|                                | on the screen entirely          |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
